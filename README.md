# NAP Tech Web Dev Test By Manuel Ruano

I have take the NAP tech dev test as start and have added react to create a frontend. I have used react-create-app to set up the project quickly.

The frontend is proxyed to the backend to have access to the endpoints/data.


## Setup

To run the app.

root && root/frontend
```shell
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
or

```shell
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

should run on localhost:3000
